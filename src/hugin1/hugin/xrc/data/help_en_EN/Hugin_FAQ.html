<p>There are no input images relevant to the output 'panorama' so hugin had nothing to do, probably because all the input images are outside the panorama 'frame' or disabled.  Open the <a href="Hugin_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Preview window">Hugin Preview window</a> or <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">Hugin Fast Preview window</a> to adjust the view, enable some images inside the panorama frame and/or adjust the crop.
</p><p>Note also that hugin versions up to and including 2009.2.0 allow you to draw an inverted crop frame where the top is below the bottom, this is easy to see in the Preview window as the entire panorama is 'greyed'. A crop frame drawn like this will result in an empty panorama and the above error message.

<a name="enblend:_excessive_overlap_detected" id="enblend:_excessive_overlap_detected"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> enblend: excessive overlap detected </span></h3>
<p>This is an error new to enblend-4.0.  Photos that nearly entirely overlap won't blend very well, enblend now fails instead of attempting to blend them.  There are various workarounds:
</p>
<ul><li> Follow the error message and remove the suggested image from the set, you probably don't need it to complete the panorama.
</li><li> Switch back to enblend-3.2.
</li><li> Hugin will merge stacked images before blending if you select 'Exposure fusion' in the <a href="Hugin_Stitcher_tab.html" title="Hugin Stitcher tab">Hugin Stitcher tab</a>. This error will go away, but Hugin will take a very different approach to variable exposure between photos.
</li><li> Mask out major parts of one image.

<p>This error is caused by a bug in the 0.7.0 release that is fixed in 0.8.0.  The problem is that your preferences are messed-up, the workaround for 0.7.0 is to go to File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Enblend and click Load Defaults -&gt; Yes -&gt; Ok

<p>This is a well known "error" for <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a>. Try to use the additional enblend parameter "--fine-mask" to get rid of the error. The parameter will result in generation of masks in higher resolution that will fix the problem in most cases. Sometimes the "--fine-mask" parameter may result in memory errors (malloc: ...), which are the result of not enough memory available due to the (much) bigger masks that are used.
</p><p>An alternative workaround would be to set the enblend --no-optimize parameter, this will place the seam directly along the middle of the image overlaps regardless of image content.  This option is also considerably faster and uses less memory.
</p><p>This error also occurs when one photo is completely covered by another, try removing redundant photos.
</p><p>Note also that for the same reasons this error often appears when rendering a scene with extreme distortion such as a stereographic 'little planet'. For this and other reasons, such as overall speed, it is always preferable to render a 'normal' 360Â° <a href="Equirectangular_Projection.html" title="Equirectangular Projection">Equirectangular Projection</a> panorama first, then load this as a single source image into a new project and render whatever views you need.
</p><p>Note (Jan 2010): This should be fixed in the latest <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> 4.0 release.

<p>There may be many reasons why a program dies before it has even started.
</p><p>One possibility is bad configuration or installation of the video drivers.  See this ticket<a class="external" href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/hugin/+bug/679427">[*]</a>.  To diagnose, try running glxgears.  On Ubuntu (the package is probably available on most Linux distributions):
</p>
<pre>
sudo apt-get mesa-utils
glxgears
</pre>
<p>If glxgears does not run on your system, Hugin will not run either.  See your Linux distribution's instruction on how to fix the video drivers.

</p><p>This problem is fixed with DRI2, e.g with fedora 11 and intel graphics hardware you can have a 'wobbly' Fast Preview window if you really want.

<p>Hugin is fully internationalised and can cope with special characters in file paths. However, hugin apparently fails on some Windows systems with Polish, Japanese, Russian or Czech codepages, the workaround is to use shell-safe ascii characters in file and folder names: <b>A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - _ .</b> This includes the path for the temporary folder which is named after your username on Windows systems.

<p>In a language other than English, French or Italian you get an error message when clicking on the help button. This will be fixed in Hugin-2009.4.0. In the meantime, the work around is to change language to one of the above three; or to ask for help on the mailing list.

your images files so that all image files in a project are unique.
</p>
<a name="Temporary_Files" id="Temporary_Files"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Temporary Files </span></h3>
<p>Hugin has a preference setting for the temporary files folder. Currently it
is not implemented properly and files will be written in the same folder as
the project file.
</p><p>A partial workaround on Linux is to start Hugin from a terminal with
</p>
<pre>
TMPDIR=/media/disk-2/tmp hugin &amp;
</pre>
<p>These temporary files have to be deleted manually after the stitch.

<p>Hugin currently does not do plausibility checks on the paths and file names that are given to it. It relies on the operating system's conventions and limitations. However Hugin uses make<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29">[*]</a> to run the stitching process, and make has more restrictive limitations than the operating system.
</p><p>Please don't use the above characters in your files and folders when you want to make sure they work with Hugin. If you absolutely need files named this way, rename them after processing. Do not file bug reports based on filenames with the above characters. The issue<a class="external" href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=550441&amp;aid=2883450&amp;group_id=77506">[*]</a> is known, analyzed, and may be fixed in the future.

<p>This is a variant of the above, but more difficult to work around.  The <i>user-name</i> is part of all paths in the user's data area, including the temporary file locations defined by TMP and TEMP.  Stitch fails almost immediately with a make path error.
</p><p>Work-around: Move your hugin data to a folder in the root directory such as C:\hugin.  Then go to the Windows Control Panel and change <i>System, Advanced, Environment, user TMP</i> to a folder in the root, such as 'C:\temp' (create it if necessary).
</p><p>Notes:  This work-around probably needs Win 7 <i>Administrator</i> privileges.
</p><p>A simpler solution should be to set hugin <i>File, Preferences, Temporary dir</i> to C:\hugin; but it doesn't fix
the problem! Seemingly, at least one temporary file still gets created in the TMP folder.

<p>This is a known limitation caused by photos being distorted into extreme 'C' and 'O' shapes. The workaround: stitch all of your pictures into a single equirectangular, and then load the equirectangular into Hugin to generate the stereographic or other projections you wanted to do in the first place.

<a name="OSX_.2F_iPhoto" id="OSX_.2F_iPhoto"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> OSX / iPhoto </span></h3>

<a name="Fast_Preview" id="Fast_Preview"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Fast Preview </span></h3>
<p>Why are there two preview windows, and which one should I use?
</p><p>For most purposes, the newer Fast Preview window is faster.  However it is still under development and sometimes shows artefacts.  The old preview still does a logarithmic tone mapping of stacked
images and is the only way to preview hdr or fused output.

<a name="Makefile_based_stitching_process" id="Makefile_based_stitching_process"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline"> Makefile based stitching process </span></h3>
<p>Can I restart a stitching process that was interrupted manually or by an error without starting everything from scratch?
</p><p>Unfortunately the Hugin Makefile system only supports restarting if you stitch on the command-line.  The GUI tools always create new temporary .pto project and Makefile files every time they stitch, so this forces make to recreate everything for every stitch.

<p>"If an image is mapped to the <a href="Nadir.html" title="Nadir">nadir</a> of a panorama and all translation parameters (X,Y,Z) are set to zero, the image is properly mapped and covers the entire nadir of the shot.

</p><p>Basically the XYZ mosaic mode as it is implemented currently in <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">Hugin</a> requires that the mosaic photos must be mapped to a plane perpendicular to the view direction - In practice this means that what you are trying to do only works if the panorama is rotated such that the nadir is in the middle of the canvas and not at the bottom.
</p><p>This isn't so bad, the nadir-in-the-middle image looks a bit weird, you can just reload the stitched <a href="Equirectangular_Projection.html" title="Equirectangular Projection">equirectangular Projection</a> result into a new single-photo project and straighten it there.

<p>The <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control points</a> editor is quite powerful, but its usage is probably not obvious on the first try. Here are some ways the developers use the Control Point panel:
</p><p>1. Selecting control points in 100% zoom.
</p><p>This method needs some scrolling, if big images are used. You might want to try the fit to window zoom setting in that case. Switch to the Control Points tab, and use the following settings:

[X] auto add
[X] auto estimate

<p>Click on a prominent feature in the left image. If the image pair already contains control points, <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">hugin</a> will try to select the point in the other image. If its the first point in this pair, click near the same feature on the right image. The second point will be placed and fine tuned automatically. If you are not happy with the placement, both points can be moved by dragging them to a better position. Press the "f" key to fine tune the point in a small area.

2. Selecting control points in fit to window mode.

If the image pair already contains control points, hugin will try to select the point in the other image. If its the first point in this pair, click near the same feature on the right image. The point will be placed and fine tuned automatically. If you are not happy with the placement, both points can be moved by clicking at the desired position. Move the point close to the desired feature and press the "f" key to fine tune the point.

<p>Cpfind is a recent addition to the Hugin suite and its parameters still require some fine tuning.  Unlike older CP generators used with Hugin, it depends on information passed in the PTO file.  Make sure that your input project file contains reasonable information about the used lens.  If you are using a fisheye or wide angle lens, try increasing the parameters --sieve1width --sieve1height --sieve1size.  A combinations that may work is "--sieve1width 50 --sieve1height 50 --sieve1size 300".  Sometimes also the option "--fullscale" might help.

<p>If the panorama looks nice but the horizon is curved, there are various ways to improve the image and straighten the horizon.
</p><p>First, try clicking the <b>Straighten</b> button in the <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">Hugin Fast Preview window</a>.
</p><p>If this doesn't work then you can use the Move/Drag tab of the <a href="Hugin_Fast_Preview_window.html" title="Hugin Fast Preview window">Hugin Fast Preview window</a> to visually straighten the panorama, drag the photos with the mouse, use the right mouse button to rotate.  One useful tip is to drag the panorama so a vertical feature is in the middle, rotate it so the feature lines up with the 'cross hair', then drag the panorama up or down until all the vertical features in the scene are vertical on the screen (holding down the shift key while dragging limits the motion to just up/down or left/right).
</p><p>If it is still curved, you have to add vertical guide control points in the "Control Points" tab. Usually two <a href="Vertical_control_points.html" title="Vertical control points">vertical control points</a> are enough to straighten the horizon nicely. Often edges of buildings, poles or other man made structures provide good vertical lines. To add a vertical control point, switch to the control point editor and select the same image on both sides. Place a control point on the left image on the upper area of the vertical feature. In the right image, select a control point on the lower area of the features, and press the Add button. Once the new point has been added, its type should automatically switch to "vertical line". You might want to switch off the auto-add and auto-estimate options while doing this to avoid naggy dialogs while adding these guide points. Two points that are roughly 90 degrees apart provide the best effect.

<p>Hugin uses the first photo as the <i>anchor</i> image and puts it in the middle by default.  This means that if you shot a sequence from left to right, the images will fill the right hand side of the panorama.  There are three ways to fix this:
</p>
<ul><li> Open the <b>preview</b> window and click the <b>center</b> button.
</li><li> or select the middle photo, hit <b>anchor this image for position</b> and <b>reset</b> in the <b>images</b> tab, then reoptimise.
</li><li> In the 'Fast Panorama Preview' window select 'Drag'. Left mouse drags the image, right mouse rotates the image.

<p>If the banding looks like posterization<a class="external" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterization">[*]</a> then this is likely due to a error with estimation of the <a href="Camera_response_curve.html" title="Camera response curve">camera response curve</a>.  To get an accurate response curve, Hugin needs significant <a href="Vignetting.html" title="Vignetting">vignetting</a> and/or <a href="Bracketing.html" title="Bracketing">bracketed exposures</a>. The workaround is to <b>Reset...</b> the <b>Camera Response</b> in the <a href="Hugin_Camera_and_Lens_tab.html" title="Hugin Camera and Lens tab">Hugin Camera and Lens tab</a> and stitch again - <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">Hugin</a> usually produces acceptable results for a simple panorama when the camera response parameters are all zero.
</p><p>If there is a wave of light and dark patches in the sky this could be due to <a href="Vignetting.html" title="Vignetting">vignetting</a> in the source photos, you can deal with this by optimising <b>Vignetting (Vb, Vc, Vd)</b> in the <a href="Hugin_Exposure_tab.html" title="Hugin Exposure tab">Hugin Exposure tab</a>.  Another workaround is to increase the number of <a href="Enblend.html" title="Enblend">enblend</a> blending levels, try setting '-l 29' as the enblend <b>Command line options</b> in the <a href="Hugin_Stitcher_tab.html" title="Hugin Stitcher tab">Hugin Stitcher tab</a>.

<p>It is normal to get little stitching <a href="Parallax.html" title="Parallax">parallax</a> errors if
the camera moves between photos.  The solution is to rotate the camera around
the <a href="No-parallax_point.html" title="No-parallax point">no-parallax point</a> using a panoramic head<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Heads">[*]</a> or philopod<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Philopod">[*]</a>.
</p><p>Otherwise you can sometimes improve things by optimising the <i>d &amp; e</i> parameters
separately - When you optimise <b>everything</b>, unselect <b>Inherit</b> in
the <b>camera and Lens</b> panel for 'd &amp; e'. Also you can open the control point window sort it by distance and check the ones large distance.
</p><p>If these parallax errors are still large, you need to decide which
parts of the scene that you want to line-up and which parts don't
matter.  Select <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control points</a> only on objects that you do want to
line-up and which are all about the same distance from the camera.
</p><p>The remaining broken lines can then be retouched in a photo editor like the gimp<a class="external" href="http://wiki.panotools.org/Gimp">[*]</a>.
The <i>shear</i> tool is ideal for bending the lines and

<p>Hugin stitches the panorama on a sphere and can't determine what is up or what is down. Even if vertical control points are assigned, there is still no notion of up and down, so the panorama can flip upside down. The solution for that is to open the Preview window, click on the Num. Trans. button in the toolbar, enter 180 in the roll field and apply. This will flip the panorama back to the right orientation.

<p>You have probably optimized 'Everything'. This will cause the optimizer to try to optimize lens parameters for each of the different lenses, and there may not be a big enough spread of control points for the optimization to work well.
When stitching photos from different lenses, or when you don't have a good spread of control points, optimize 'Position, view &amp; Barrel (y,p,r,v,b).

<p>Did you observe that the output is cropped at the +-90Â° borders? (e.g. saw teeth like borders in the fast preview window)
</p><p>Then you have probably used the translation parameters X/Y/Z. This behaviour is a fundamental limitation of the used approach of the translation parameters. It is (internal) working in the rectilinear space, which is limited to maximal FOV of 180Â°, and therefore also the output is limited to FOV&lt;180Â° (for more information see <a href="Stitching_a_photo-mosaic.html" title="Stitching a photo-mosaic">Stitching a photo-mosaic</a>).
</p><p>The solution/workaround is to set all X/Y/Z values to zero or to limit the horizontal field of view (HFOV) to a value smaller than 180Â°.

<p>Starting with Hugin-2009.2 nona has a new, experimental feature: it can use the video card (GPU) to accelerate the stitching. How much acceleration you will get, if any, depends on the combination of video card and driver.

<p>Not necessarily. This functionality is highly experimental. It may be that you have an outdated driver, or that the functionality is not supported on your video card. Note down the version of the driver you are using and the specs of your video card (GPU and RAM). Then update to the latest driver from nVidia<a class="external" href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/drivers.html">[*]</a> or AMD<a class="external" href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx">[*]</a> (ATI has been bought by AMD). Currently only these two families of GPUs support the functionality.

<p>At the moment we have too little information to predict this. We know that only nVidia and AMD(ATI) powered video cards work, and not all of them. The more recent the video card, the higher the likelihood that it works. Improve your chances by updating to the latest driver for your GPU.

<p>Enblend and Enfuse can be optimized at build time for different hardware configurations. This yields four categories of Enblend-Enfuse builds, with a few variations. If you build Enblend-Enfuse from source, check the build options in the README file. If you download a binary, you can find out how it has been built with the following command:
</p>
<pre> enblend -v -V
</pre>
<p>look for the following in the output text:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Extra feature: OpenMP: yes</b> this version has OpenMP.
</li><li> <b>Extra feature: image cache: yes</b> this version has image cache
</li><li> <b>Extra feature: GPU acceleration: yes</b> this version has GPU support
</li><li> SSE-support is not mentioned, you'll find out if you have an unsupported CPU and the binary will refuse to run.
</li></ol>
<p>These are approximate guidelines to help you choose what may work for you:
</p>
<ul><li> if you have a recent, multi-core / multi-thread CPU, you probably want the OpenMP-enabled version. Note however that speed improvement does not scale well, so don't expect a 6 cores CPU to be 3x faster than a 2 cores one.
</li><li> if you have a recent, fast video card, you probably want the GPU-enabled version.   This is not mutually exclusive with OpenMP and a good builder will add both features to his binaries.  If speed is important to you, you want to test which of the two is faster on your system.  If system responsiveness is important to you, the GPU-enabled version frees CPU resources for your other tasks.  Note that even if your binary is GPU-enabled, the GPU will not be used unless you specify the option `--gpu`.
</li><li> if you have an old CPU without SSE2 support, you want a NOSSE build.  This is the least performing version.
</li><li> Last but not least, if blending fails because of large images, try the image cache variation.  The image cache allows for processing of large project when memory is scarce but images are large (and disk is large enough too).  Image cache is incompatible with OpenMP, but a good bilder will make this version GPU-enabled too, so test it with `--gpu` if speed is important.

For running the OpenMP variants you will need "Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86)"<a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B2DA534-3E03-4391-8A4D-074B9F2BC1BF&amp;displaylang=en">[*]</a>.
</p><p><br />
3. enblend_nosse.exe/enfuse_nosse.exe
</p><p>If you have an old CPU without SSE2<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2">[*]</a> support, you want a NOSSE build.  This is the least performing version.
You will need to download a separate package to get this version from sourceforge.net<a class="external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/enblend/files/enblend-enfuse/enblend-enfuse-4.0/enblend-enfuse-4.0-win32-nosse.zip/download">[*]</a>
</p><p>All three variants can utilize a modern graphic card to accelerate the optimizing of the seam line between two images. To use this feature supply the parameter --gpu to enblend.

<p>At the time of writing the official Debian/Ubuntu package ships with one executable only, however in July 2010 a change has been committed to debian-unstable that delivers two binaries:
</p><p>1. enblend/enfuse
</p><p>These executables are the standard release.  They are using one processor core and the image cache for processing very big images. 
</p><p>2. enblend_mp/enfuse_mp
</p><p>These executables can utilize several cores of modern multi-core processors and are therefore significantly faster on modern processors.  But they may fail on very big images because they are working without the image cache.
</p><p>Both variants can utilize a modern graphic card to accelerate the optimizing of the seam line between two images. To use this feature supply the parameter --gpu to enblend.

<p>If you think you have found a bug in Hugin, please report it to help us make Hugin better.  Before reporting a bug, try a few things to make sure it is really a bug.  Then collect the following information and transmit it to the developers via the bug tracker.
</p>
<ol><li> What version of Hugin are you using?  Consider upgrading and try to reproduce the bug.  Maybe it was fixed in a more recent version.
</li><li> read the output log.  Are there any suggested actions or messages in there?  If so, follow the advice and try again.  Save the output log to a text file and attach it to the report if you file a bug report. 
</li><li> Attach the .pto file to the bug report.
</li><li> Use a meaningful title for the bug report.  The line reporting the error in the output log is a good place to start.  Before filing a new bug report, check for duplicates.  Launchpad does already a little bit so.  If the bug is already known, add yourself and you files with a comment to the bug.  This will give your report and your log more visibility than if somebody looking at your bug has to mark it as duplicate.

<p>We trust you that you are experiencing the issue on your end and that it bugs you, but most likely the solution lies not in the Hugin codebase.  If you feel that your report has been marked Invalid by mistake, feel free to reply and to set the status back to New for a re-evaluation.  Somebody may explain to you why the report was marked as Invalid and what you can do.

<p>Every system is different and those trying to help fixing the bugs do not see and experience what you do.  In order to help you, they are likely to need more information.  Without that information the bug report is of little use.  We mark as Incomplete reports that require additional information.  Once you provide it, please mark the report status as New again
