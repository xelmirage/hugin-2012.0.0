			<p>The <b>Images tab</b> is used to manage the images in a <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">hugin</a> project. Additionally the positions of the images in the final panorama can be edited here.
</p>

<a name="Adding_images" id="Adding_images"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Adding images </span></h1>
<p>Images can either be added with the <b>Add individual images...</b> and <b>Add time series of images...</b> button or via drag and drop. <b>Add time series of images...</b> adds all images with a similar file modification time as the selected image; if the the project is empty then a file dialogue opens to allow you to pick this initial file.
</p>
<a name="Control_points" id="Control_points"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Control points </span></h1>
<p>Individual <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control points</a> can be created and edited in the <a href="Hugin_Control_Points_tab.html" title="Hugin Control Points tab">Hugin Control Points tab</a>, here in the <b>images tab</b> they can be manipulated together.
</p><p>Automatic creation of <a href="Control_points.html" title="Control points">control points</a> can be done by pressing the <b>Create control Points</b> button (if you select just some images, then control points will only be found for those selected). <a href="Hugin.html" title="Hugin">Hugin</a> will then launch whichever control point generator is selected in <b>Settings</b> to add detected control points to the project. The <a href="Hugin_Preferences.html" title="Hugin Preferences">Hugin Preferences</a> determine the list of these <i>autopano</i> programs and can be used and set further options and add new tools to the list.
</p><p><b>Remove Points</b> does exactly what its name suggests, it removes control points between the selected images, or all control points if no image is selected.
</p><p>Often a project has many control points attached to clouds in the sky, this is usually unwanted as clouds move between photos.  Clicking <b>Run Celeste</b> will attempt to identify 'sky' control points using the <a href="Using_Celeste_with_hugin.html" title="Using Celeste with hugin">celeste</a> tool and delete them.
</p><p>Using <b>Clean control points</b> button, hugin will try to find and remove outlying control points using statistical methods.
</p>
<a name="Image_Position" id="Image_Position"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Image Position </span></h1>
<p>In the <b>Image Position</b> section, the orientation of the selected images in the final panorama can be specified by <a href="Yaw.html" title="Yaw">yaw</a>, <a href="Pitch.html" title="Pitch">pitch</a> and <a href="Roll.html" title="Roll">roll</a> angle (in degrees); and the X, Y, and Z translation parameters. The <b>Reset</b> button will reset all angles and translations to zero. This is useful if the optimizer could not determine the image orientation well and got stuck with a suboptimal result. It is possible to select multiple images at the same time. Changes in orientation will be applied to all selected images.
</p><p>Note that it is also possible to reset <b>Image Orientation</b> along with other parameters using the <b>Reset...</b> button on the <a href="Hugin_Camera_and_Lens_tab.html" title="Hugin Camera and Lens tab">Hugin Camera and Lens tab</a>.
</p><p>Select <b>Anchor this image for position</b> to indicate that a particular image shouldn't move when
optimising with the <a href="Hugin_Optimizer_tab.html" title="Hugin Optimizer tab">hugin Optimizer tab</a>.  Only one image can be the <i>anchor</i>, and by default this
is the first image in the project.
</p><p>Image orientation can be linked between a group of images if they are already aligned. For example, if they form a bracketed set shot on a sturdy tripod. To do this, select all the images in the stack, and press the <b>New stack</b> button. You can also move images into an existing stack without selecting all the other images in the stack: press <b>Change stack...</b> and enter the stack number you want the selected images to join. The stack number of each image is given in the table.
</p><p>If your images form approximately aligned stacks, you can create stacks as usual, select all the images and then uncheck <b>Link</b> by the image position. Approximately aligned stacks are common when you shoot bracketed sets handheld, or in windy conditions with a light tripod. Hugin will remember that the images form a stack, but does not force the image orientation and translation to be the same across the stack. This is useful for specifying stacks when you have a Panorama with Stacks <a href="Hugin_Preferences.html#Control_Point_Detectors" title="Hugin Preferences">control point detector configuration</a> before control point generation. You do not have to manually mark approximately aligned stacks in other circumstances, however.
</p>
<a name="Exposure" id="Exposure"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Exposure </span></h1>
<p>Selecting <b>Anchor this image for exposure</b> will indicate that a particular image should be used as
an unchanging reference <i>anchor</i> when optimising <b>Exposure</b> or <b>White balance</b> in the
<a href="Hugin_Exposure_tab.html" title="Hugin Exposure tab">hugin Exposure tab</a>.  Usually this should be the image with the least under or over-exposure or
the image with the most typical <b>White balance</b>.
