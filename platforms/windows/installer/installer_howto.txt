PRE-REQUISITES
* you have built hugin on Windows from source using the hugin SDK and it works.
* install InnoSetup and InnoSetup QuickStart Pack
  from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isdl.php - I used version 5.1.8
  but any recent ones should work.
PROCESS
* start with a clean Hugin SDK
* build hugin as usual and test that it works
* build the INSTALL project 
* browse to the INSTALL folder in the build folder
* doubleclick hugin_prerelease.iss or hugin_release.iss if you are building a release version
* press F9 to run the compiler
* if compilation breaks, it will highlight in red the faulty line
* after compilation is successful the installer will run
* let the installer run until the end. If it drops back to InnoSetup
  with an error the faulty line will be highlighted
* Once hugin is installed, test it thoroughly
* Uninstall and reinstall with different settings
* When you are sure that everything is OK, fetch the installer for distribution
  from INSTALL\Output\
* if dropped back to the InnoSetup compiler with a highlighted line,
  check that the mentioned files are available. If you can, correct it and
  post back the corrected .iss file. If you need help, post a request to the
  bug tracker with the relevant information.
