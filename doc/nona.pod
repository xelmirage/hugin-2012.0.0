B<nona> [options] B<-o> I<output> I<project_file> (image files)


=head1 DESCRIPTION

itself is quite simple, no seam feathering is done.

Only the non-antialiasing interpolators of PanoTools are supported.

The following output formats (B<n> option of PanoTools B<p> script
line) are supported:

=over

=item JPEG, TIFF, PNG  : Single image formats without feathered blending

=item TIFF_m          : multiple tiff files

=item TIFF_multilayer : Multilayer tiff files, readable by The Gimp 2.0

=item B<-c>

Create coordinate images (only TIFF_m output)

=item B<-v>

Quiet, do not output progress indicators

=item B<-t> I<num>

Number of threads to be used (default: number of available cores)
